This project was created using Create React App. For more information about
this framework, please view the documentation [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To install the node modules make sure you have the latest version of node.js and npm installed on your machine.

    cd news-aggregator
    npm install

To run the app on your localhost
    npm start

Once you have reached the point where you want to deploy this. You can do 
`npm run build`. This will create a build folder in the same directory which
can then be placed into something like an S3 bucket which supports static 
website hosting.
